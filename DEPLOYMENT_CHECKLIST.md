- [ ] Set secure cookie settings
- [ ] Enable API rate limiting
- [ ] Review CORS configuration
- [ ] Audit API key handling

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable gzip/brotli compression
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Optimize bundle sizes
- [ ] Enable database indexes
- [ ] Configure caching headers

### 4. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
- [ ] Configure application monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring

## Production Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Backend Deployment
1. **Prepare Production Server**
   ```bash
   # Install Python 3.9+
   # Install MongoDB or configure Atlas connection
   # Set up reverse proxy (nginx)
   ```

2. **Deploy Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Set environment variables
   uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create MongoDB indexes
   # Set up database backups
   # Configure connection pooling
   ```

### Phase 2: Frontend Deployment
1. **Build Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-api-domain.com npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to CDN/Static Hosting**
   ```bash
   # Upload build folder to hosting provider
   # Configure domain and SSL
   # Set up redirects for SPA routing
   ```

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test all API endpoints
- [ ] Verify microphone permissions work
- [ ] Test speech recognition functionality
- [ ] Verify AI response generation
- [ ] Test hotkey controls
- [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Test with different browsers

## Go-Live Checklist

### Critical Tests
- [ ] User registration/login flow
- [ ] API key validation process
- [ ] Real-time speech transcription
- [ ] AI response generation
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Error boundaries functioning
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] API response time < 500ms
- [ ] Speech recognition latency < 1 second
- [ ] AI response time < 5 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage stable during long sessions

### Security Verification
- [ ] No API keys exposed in browser
- [ ] HTTPS enforced everywhere
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Input validation working

## Post-Launch Monitoring

### Week 1
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Monitor API usage patterns
- [ ] Check security logs

### Week 2-4
- [ ] Analyze usage patterns
- [ ] Optimize based on real data
- [ ] Plan feature improvements
- [ ] Review and update documentation

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Revert to previous working version
   - [ ] Update DNS if needed
   - [ ] Notify users of maintenance

2. **Investigation**
   - [ ] Analyze logs and metrics
   - [ ] Identify root cause
   - [ ] Test fixes in staging
   - [ ] Plan proper fix deployment

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Uptime > 99.9%
